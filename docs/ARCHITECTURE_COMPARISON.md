# Architecture Comparison: Microservices vs Modular Monolith

This project demonstrates both architectural approaches to showcase their trade-offs and use cases.

## 🏗️ Microservices Architecture

### Services:
- **user-service** (User management, authentication)
- **inventory-service** (Product catalog, stock management)
- **order-service** (Order processing, fulfillment)
- **payment-service** (Payment processing, external integrations)
- **notification-service** (Multi-channel notifications)
- **bff-service** (Backend For Frontend aggregation)

### Characteristics:
- ✅ **Independent deployment** - Each service can be updated separately
- ✅ **Technology diversity** - Different databases, languages per service
- ✅ **Fault isolation** - Service failures don't cascade
- ✅ **Team autonomy** - Different teams can own different services
- ✅ **Scalability** - Scale individual services based on load

### Communication:
- **HTTP/REST APIs** for synchronous communication
- **Messaging (RabbitMQ/Kafka)** for asynchronous events
- **Database per service** - No shared data access

### Trade-offs:
- ❌ **Network overhead** - HTTP calls between services
- ❌ **Distributed transactions** - Complex SAGA patterns required
- ❌ **Operational complexity** - Multiple deployments, monitoring
- ❌ **Data consistency** - Eventual consistency challenges

## 🧩 Modular Monolith Architecture

### Service:
- **bff-service** (Single deployment with multiple internal aggregation modules)

### Modules:
- **user-aggregation** - User data aggregation, session management, user-specific caching
- **order-aggregation** - Order data aggregation, order workflow orchestration, order analytics
- **inventory-aggregation** - Product catalog aggregation, search optimization, inventory caching
- **analytics-aggregation** - Cross-service analytics, dashboard data preparation, reporting

### Characteristics:
- ✅ **Single deployment** - All modules deployed together
- ✅ **ACID transactions** - True database transactions across modules
- ✅ **Consistent technology** - Unified Java/Spring stack
- ✅ **Simple operations** - One service to deploy and monitor
- ✅ **Direct imports** - Type-safe module communication

### Communication:
- **Direct Java imports** for synchronous module calls
- **Spring Events (ApplicationEventPublisher)** for decoupled internal messaging
- **Shared database** with module-specific schemas

### Trade-offs:
- ❌ **Coupling risk** - Modules can become too interdependent
- ❌ **Single point of failure** - Entire platform affected by module issues
- ❌ **Scaling limitations** - Scale entire monolith, not individual modules
- ❌ **Technology constraints** - All modules must use same tech stack

## 🎯 When to Use Which?

### Choose Microservices When:
- **Team size** > 2-pizza teams per service
- **Different scaling needs** per service
- **Technology diversity** required
- **Independent release cycles** needed
- **High availability** with fault isolation required

### Choose Modular Monolith When:
- **Small to medium teams** (< 10 developers)
- **Consistent technology** preferences
- **Strong transactional requirements**
- **Rapid development** and iteration needed
- **Simple deployment** and operations preferred

## 🔄 Evolution Path

This project demonstrates the **evolution path**:

1. **Start with Modular Monolith** (bff-service)
   - Fast frontend development and data aggregation
   - Clear module boundaries for different data domains
   - ACID transactions and internal data consistency

2. **Extract to Microservices** as needed
   - When aggregation modules become too complex
   - When independent scaling of aggregation is required
   - When different frontend teams need separate BFF services

3. **Hybrid Approach** (this project's final state)
   - Core business logic as microservices (user, inventory, order, payment, notification)
   - Frontend aggregation as modular monolith (bff-service)
   - Best of both worlds - distributed business logic, unified frontend layer

## 💡 Key Learnings

By implementing both patterns, you'll understand:

- **Communication patterns**: HTTP/REST vs direct imports vs messaging
- **Transaction management**: Distributed SAGA vs local ACID
- **Testing strategies**: Contract testing vs unit testing
- **Deployment complexity**: Multiple services vs single monolith
- **Monitoring needs**: Distributed tracing vs single-service metrics
- **Data consistency**: Eventual vs immediate consistency

This comparison provides real hands-on experience with both architectural approaches and their practical implications.
