# Distributed Transaction Patterns: SAGA vs Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

This project implements both distributed transaction patterns to demonstrate their trade-offs and use cases.

## 🔄 SAGA Pattern (Eventually Consistent)

### Characteristics:
- ✅ **High availability** - Services remain available during transactions
- ✅ **Scalability** - No distributed locking, better performance
- ✅ **Fault tolerance** - Individual service failures don't block others
- ❌ **Eventually consistent** - Temporary inconsistent states possible
- ❌ **Complex compensation** - Requires rollback logic for each step

### Implementation Strategy:
```
Order Processing SAGA:
1. Create Order → Success/Compensation
2. Reserve Inventory → Success/Compensation  
3. Process Payment → Success/Compensation
4. Send Notification → Success/Compensation

If step fails → Execute compensation chain backwards
```

### Use Cases:
- **Order fulfillment**: inventory reservation → payment → shipping → notification
- **User registration**: account creation → profile setup → email verification  
- **Content workflows**: upload → processing → moderation → publish
- **Analytics processing**: data collection → transformation → aggregation

## ⚛️ Two-Phase Commit (2PC) (Immediately Consistent)

### Characteristics:
- ✅ **ACID consistency** - All-or-nothing atomic transactions
- ✅ **Immediate consistency** - No eventual consistency delays
- ✅ **Simple rollback** - Automatic transaction abort
- ❌ **Blocking protocol** - Can halt system if coordinator fails
- ❌ **Lower availability** - All participants must be available
- ❌ **Performance overhead** - Multiple round-trips and locks

### Implementation Strategy:
```
Critical Payment Processing (2PC):
Phase 1 - PREPARE:
├── Payment Service: "Can you process $100?" → PREPARED
├── Inventory Service: "Can you reserve item?" → PREPARED  
└── Order Service: "Can you create order?" → PREPARED

Phase 2 - COMMIT:
├── Payment Service: "COMMIT the payment" → COMMITTED
├── Inventory Service: "COMMIT the reservation" → COMMITTED
└── Order Service: "COMMIT the order" → COMMITTED

If any PREPARE fails → ABORT all participants
```

### Use Cases:
- **Payment processing**: validate → charge → confirm (immediate consistency required)
- **Account transfers**: debit source account → credit destination account
- **Stock reservation**: check availability → reserve → confirm (strict consistency)
- **Financial reporting**: transaction → audit log → compliance record

## 🔀 Hybrid Implementation Strategy

### Business Flow Segregation:

#### **Use SAGA for:**
- **User Registration Flow** (user creation → profile setup → email → preferences)
- **Order Fulfillment Flow** (order → inventory → shipping → notification)
- **Analytics Processing** (event collection → aggregation → reporting)
- **Content Management** (post creation → media processing → indexing)

#### **Use 2PC for:**
- **Payment Processing** (payment → account debit → transaction log)
- **Inventory Reservation** (stock check → reservation → confirmation)
- **Financial Operations** (transfer → debit → credit → audit log)
- **Critical State Changes** (user role changes → permissions → audit)

### Implementation Architecture:

## 📊 Performance & Consistency Matrix

| Pattern | Consistency | Availability | Scalability | Complexity | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **SAGA** | Eventually | High | High | Medium | Business workflows |
| **2PC** | Immediate | Medium | Low | Low | Critical operations |

## 🧪 Educational Benefits

By implementing both patterns in the same system, you'll learn:

### **Practical Trade-offs:**
- **Performance impact** - 2PC roundtrips vs SAGA async processing
- **Failure handling** - Compensation vs rollback mechanisms  
- **Monitoring complexity** - SAGA state tracking vs 2PC phase monitoring
- **Debugging challenges** - Eventually consistent states vs immediate failures

### **Real-world Decision Making:**
- **When to choose** each pattern based on business requirements
- **How to combine** both patterns in the same system
- **Migration strategies** - Moving from 2PC to SAGA or vice versa
- **Monitoring and observability** requirements for each pattern

## 🔧 Implementation Plan (Phase 6)

### **SAGA Implementation:**
- Event-driven choreography using RabbitMQ/Kafka
- Orchestration using dedicated SAGA coordinator service
- Compensation handlers for rollback scenarios
- State persistence and recovery mechanisms

### **2PC Implementation:**
- Transaction coordinator service with participant registry
- Prepare/Commit/Abort phase handlers in each service
- Distributed locking and timeout management
- Transaction log persistence for crash recovery

### **Comparison Framework:**
- Same business operations implemented with both patterns
- Performance benchmarking and load testing
- Failure injection testing (network partitions, service crashes)
- Consistency verification and audit trails

This comparison provides invaluable hands-on experience with distributed transaction management - essential knowledge for any microservices architect.
