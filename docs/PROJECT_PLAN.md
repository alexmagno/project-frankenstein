## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

This project follows industry best practices and architectural patterns:

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with hexagonal architecture
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Rich domain models with bounded contexts
- **SOLID Principles**: Maintainable and extensible code
- **12-Factor App**: Cloud-native application principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through async messaging
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation where applicable
- **Modern Java 21 LTS Features**: Leveraging the latest LTS version with Records, Virtual Threads for high-concurrency, Pattern Matching for cleaner code, String Templates for safer string handling, and Sequenced Collections

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database Architecture Decision**

**Shared Database with Schema Separation**: This project uses a **shared PostgreSQL database** with logical domain separation through schemas, rather than separate databases per service. This architectural choice provides several benefits for a learning environment:

**Benefits**:
- **Simplified Operations**: Single database to manage, backup, and monitor
- **ACID Transactions**: Cross-domain transactions without distributed transaction complexity
- **Data Consistency**: Easier to maintain referential integrity across domains
- **Development Efficiency**: Simpler local development setup and testing
- **Cost Effective**: Single database instance reduces infrastructure costs

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Schema-Based Separation**: `user_domain`, `product_domain`, `order_domain`, `shared_domain`
- **Service-Specific Users**: Each service connects with its own database user for auditing
- **Cross-Schema Permissions**: Controlled access to related domain data
- **Coordinated Migrations**: Flyway manages schema evolution across all domains

**Trade-offs Acknowledged**:
- Services are more tightly coupled at the data layer
- Requires discipline to avoid services directly accessing other domains' data
- Schema changes require coordination across services
- Scaling requires vertical scaling of the shared database

This approach is well-suited for learning microservices patterns while maintaining operational simplicity.
