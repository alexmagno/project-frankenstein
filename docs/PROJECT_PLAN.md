## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

This project follows industry best practices and architectural patterns:

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with hexagonal architecture
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Rich domain models with bounded contexts
- **Database Per Service**: Each microservice owns its data and SAGA coordination
- **SOLID Principles**: Maintainable and extensible code
- **12-Factor App**: Cloud-native application principles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling through async messaging
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation where applicable
- **SAGA Pattern**: Distributed transaction coordination per service
- **Modern Java 21 LTS Features**: Leveraging the latest LTS version with Records, Virtual Threads for high-concurrency, Pattern Matching for cleaner code, String Templates for safer string handling, and Sequenced Collections

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database Architecture Decision**

**Database Per Service with SAGA Coordination**: This project uses **separate PostgreSQL databases per service** with distributed SAGA pattern coordination. This architectural choice demonstrates enterprise microservices best practices:

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Service Isolation**: Each service owns its database and domain (user_db, product_db, order_db, etc.)
- **SAGA Coordination**: Each database includes saga_coordination schema for distributed transactions
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Critical operations use 2PC for immediate consistency (vs SAGA's eventual consistency)
- **Event Store**: Each service has its own event_store schema for domain events
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Services communicate via events (RabbitMQ) and API calls
- **Analytics Aggregation**: Separate analytics_db for cross-service reporting and metrics
- **Modular Monolith**: BFF service demonstrates internal modules with direct imports + Spring Events

**Benefits**:
- **Service Autonomy**: Each service can evolve its schema independently
- **Scalability**: Individual databases can be scaled based on service needs
- **Fault Isolation**: Database failure affects only one service
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can choose optimal database technology (future evolution)
- **Real-world Pattern**: Reflects enterprise microservices architecture

**SAGA Pattern Integration**:
- **Distributed Coordination**: Each service manages its own SAGA state
- **Cross-Service Transactions**: SAGAs coordinate operations across multiple databases
- **Compensation Actions**: Each service handles its own rollback logic
- **Event-Driven Choreography**: Services coordinate via RabbitMQ events
- **Audit Trail**: Each service maintains complete transaction history

**Trade-offs Acknowledged**:
- **Operational Complexity**: Multiple databases to manage and monitor  
- **Distributed Transactions**: SAGA patterns instead of simple ACID transactions
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency between services
- **Cross-Service Queries**: Requires event sourcing and read projections

This approach demonstrates **real enterprise microservices architecture** with proper service boundaries and distributed transaction coordination.
